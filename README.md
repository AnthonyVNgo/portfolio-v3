# Portfolio-v3
 The third iteration of my portfolio built with Hugo Static Site Generator
<br><br>
## Why I Built This
I built this project because I wanted to update my work and my portfolio after learning that a single page design is more favorable over a multipage design. I also wanted to make changes from my last iteration, namely the hover effect which didn't translate well over on mobile devices. I decided to stick with Hugo because it would be easy to update my work thanks after setting up and adding content via .md files.
