A multipage portfolio built to showcase my work, easily add updates to projects via Hugo, and for users contact me. The reason why I decided re-work my portfolio is because after some polling, I learned that a singlepage portfolio provides a more frictionless experience for visitors and possible recruiters. Each additional click to a different page could become a potential deterrent. Another reason is because my previous design included hover effects, which didn't account for the mobile experience.
