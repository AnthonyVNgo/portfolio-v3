A multipage portfolio built with Hugo and Bootstrap5. I built this because I needed to update my work and wanted to create a multipage site, and I used Hugo because it simplified blogging and updating content. (I learned that singlepagers provide less friction for visitors. Each click to a different page becomes a potential deterrent. V2's design included hover effects, which didn't perform well on mobile.)
