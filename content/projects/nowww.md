A full stack JavaScript application for professionals who want to share brief written descriptions of their current projects (Nowwws). This project was inspired by Derek Siver's concept of a 'Now Page' and combines the user profile features from OurNows.com with the card gallery aesthetic of ADPList.org. The app allows users to view a gallery of other users and perform CRUD operations through editing profile details along with adding and deleting Nowww entries.
