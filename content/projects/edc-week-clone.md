title: "EDC Week Clone"
draft: false

A front-end focused project built with Vue, Vue Router, and Tailwind CSS. I built this side project because my new position's tech stack uses Vue instead of what I learned in my bootcamp (React). I wanted to build my own project to get the ins and outs and fundamentals down and I like Insomniac events, so I decided to make a clone of its 2022 EDC Week page.
