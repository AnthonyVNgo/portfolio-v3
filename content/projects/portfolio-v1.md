Every developer (or working professional for that matter) needs a portfolio to showcase their work. This is my one-pager portfolio built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a bit of Tailwind CSS to highlight my skills as a developer. The portfolio's look and feel was inspired by another designer that I used as reference material. Check it out and see how my coding has evolved.
