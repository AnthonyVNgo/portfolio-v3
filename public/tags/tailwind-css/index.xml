      <description>A clone of EDC Week&amp;rsquo;s webpage built with Vue3, Vue Router4, and Tailwind CSS. I built this side project because my new position&amp;rsquo;s tech stack uses Vue instead of what I learned in my bootcamp (React). I wanted to build my own project to get the ins and outs and fundamentals down and I like Insomniac events, so I decided to make a clone of its 2022 EDC Week page.</description>

      <description>Every developer (or working professional for that matter) needs a portfolio to showcase their work. This is my one-pager portfolio built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a bit of Tailwind CSS to highlight my skills as a developer. The portfolio&amp;rsquo;s look and feel was inspired by another designer that I used as reference material. Check it out and see how my coding has evolved.</description>
