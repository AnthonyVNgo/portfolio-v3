      <description>A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript web application for professionals who want to relocate to urban areas. This project was inspired by my 2 years living abroad, itch for travel, and plan for relocating as I break into tech. The web app includes features that allow users to search for quality of life scores for urban areas and store or remove cities from a favorited or skipped list.</description>
